    Advanced triage calculation using:
    - Symptom-specific risk factors
    - Severity multipliers
    - Age group considerations
    - Duration impact assessment
    """
    base_score = sum(symptom_weights[s] for s in symptoms)
    severity_factor = severity_multipliers[severity]
    age_factor = age_multipliers[age_group]
    duration_factor = calculate_duration_impact(duration)
    
    return base_score * severity_factor * age_factor * duration_factor
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Model Training Fails
```bash
# Solution: Check data format
rasa data validate

# Re-train with debug
rasa train --debug
```

#### 2. Actions Server Connection Error
```bash
# Check endpoints.yml configuration
action_endpoint:
  url: "http://localhost:5055/webhook"

# Restart action server
rasa run actions --debug
```

#### 3. Frontend API Connection Issues
```javascript
// Update API endpoint in ChatInterface.js
const RASA_API_URL = 'http://localhost:5005/webhooks/rest/webhook';
```

#### 4. Low NLU Accuracy
- Add more training examples to `data/nlu.yml`
- Increase model epochs in `config.yml`
- Review entity annotations for consistency

### Performance Optimization

```bash
# Enable GPU acceleration (if available)
pip install torch[cuda]

# Optimize model size
rasa train --config config_optimized.yml

# Enable caching
export RASA_CACHE_ENABLED=true
```
